== BackBone Checker

Backbone checkers is a simple project I created to find a way to integrate backbone.js to Ruby on Rails. This project is not about functionalit but about creating conventions that will guide me in future projects using both backbone and Rails. 

I am a firm believer in structure and convention when developing any project. Having a set way of doing things allows for readability and productivity. From the moment I started to use backbone.js I realize that while it provides a mean to structure javascript, there was not a universal right way to do so. This project is just my attempt in finding a preffered method to structure my work when using backbone.js with rails.
